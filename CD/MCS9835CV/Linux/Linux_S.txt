This installation guide describes the procedures to install NetMos Technology Nm9735CV, Nm9745CV, Nm9835CV, Nm9845CV PCI serial ports in Linux platform.

Linux Platform

l Operating System		: RedHat, SuSe
l Terminal Emulation AP		: minicom
l Internet Dialer		: Kppp


Find the available serial ports

Since Linux only support 4 serial ports (ttyS0, ttyS1, ttyS2, ttyS3) under the default condition. Most likely, ttyS0 & ttyS1 are supported by mother board's built-in serial controllers and ttyS2 & ttyS3 are free for additional I/O card.

Serial ports could be checked by the following commands.

setserial  /dev/ttyS0 -a 		(COM-1)
setserial  /dev/ttyS1 -a 		(COM-2)
setserial  /dev/ttyS2 -a 		(COM-3)
setserial  /dev/ttyS3 -a 		(COM-4)

If COM-1 is used by mouse, the response is similar to

/dev/ttyS0 : Device or resource busy    

If the COM-1 does not attach any device, the response is similar to 

/dev/ttyS0, Line 0, 	UART: 16550A, Port: 0x3f8, irq: 4
                 	Baud_base: 115200, clos_delay: 50, divisor: 0
                 	closing_wait: 3000, closing_wait2: infinite
                 	Flags: spd_normal skip_test

In case ttyS2 (COM-3) is free, the response for command  setserial /dev/ttyS2 -a is shown below.

/dev/ttyS2, Line 2, 	UART: unknown, Port: 0x3e8, irq: 4
                     	Baud_base: 115200, clos_delay: 50, divisor: 0
                     	closing_wait: 3000, closing_wait2: infinite
                     	Flags: spd_normal skip_test

Find the PCI card resource ( I/O port address & IRQ) for the serial ports

Enter the command  more  /proc/pci

The response is similar to the following
      
			Bus 0, Device 11, function 0:
			Serial controller : Unknown vendor Unknown device (rev 01).
			Vendor id=9710, Device id=9735
					Device id=9745

From the  /proc/pci file, it is possible to find the PCI card's I/O port address and IRQ. Especially, the NetMos parts always shows

			Vendor id=9710, Device id=9735
					Device id=9745
					Device id=9820
					Device id=9825
					Device id=9835
					Device id=9845
	
Configure the parameters for ttyS2 or ttyS3

Enter (if ttyS2 or ttyS3 are free)

           setserial  /dev/ttyS2 port 0xc000 UART 16550A
                       irq 11 Baud_base 115200

           setserial  /dev/ttyS3 port 0xc008 UART 16550A
                       irq 11 Baud_base 115200

Check the setting for ttyS2 or ttyS3

Type setserial  /dev/ttyS2 -a

      			/dev/ttyS2, Line 2, UART: 16550A, Port: 0xc000, irq: 11
                 	Baud_base: 115200, clos_delay: 50, divisor: 0
                 	closing_wait: 3000, closing_wait2: infinite
                 	Flags: spd_normal skip_test


The ttyS2 or ttyS3 are ready for application
