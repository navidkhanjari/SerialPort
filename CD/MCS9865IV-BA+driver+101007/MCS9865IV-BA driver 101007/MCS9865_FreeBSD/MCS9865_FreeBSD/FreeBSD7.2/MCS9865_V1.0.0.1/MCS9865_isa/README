For isa-serial driver kernel need to compile.
Procedure for kernel compilation.

1. Install the kernel source
2. cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf
3. cp GENERIC MYKERNEL
4. vi MYKERNEL ( edit MYKERNEL file by enabling puc driver)
   (ex: device  puc  (remove the # before device))
6. config MYKERNEL
7. cd ../compile/MYKERNEL
8. make cleandepend
9. make depend
10. make
11. make install
12. reboot



Procedure:

	1. #make 	: To compile the driver.
	2. #make ld	: To load the driver.
	3. #make uld	: To unload the driver.


	After loading the driver, with dmesg command one should see the following messge.

puc0: [FILTER]
uart0: <16550 or compatible> on puc0
uart0: [FILTER]
uart1: <16550 or compatible> on puc0
uart1: [FILTER]
ppc1: <Parallel port> on puc0
ppc1: Generic chipset (NIBBLE-only) in COMPATIBLE mode
ppbus1: <Parallel port bus> on ppc1
plip1: cannot reserve interrupt, failed.
lpt1: <Printer> on ppbus1
lpt1: Polled port
ppi1: <Parallel I/O> on ppbus1


Detection: 
	Tested with ISA 2 serial and one parallel device.
	
	To know serial port name check the /dev directory.
	uart0 indicates /dev/ttyu0
	similarly uartX indicates /dev/ttyuX where X=0 to f

	where uart0 and uart1 will be displayed by executing "dmesg" command

	The serials ports are /dev/ttyu0, /dev/ttyu1 ... /dev/ttyuf
	The paralle port is /dev/lpt1.


Testing serial port:
minicom Usage:

	The minicom application is also placed in the same folder 
	usage: ./minicom -s


	Tested Upto 1x baudrate with minicom.
	
Testing parallel port:

	Tested only command line printing.

	1. create a text file.
	2. print it using "cat <file name> >  /dev/lpt1"
