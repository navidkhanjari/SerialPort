The Following files will be there with the tar of the Driver:

	99xx.c
	99xx.h
	Makefile
	README	
	mcs99xx

Building the Driver:
--------------------
	Change to the folder with the Starex source files. And run the following Command:
		$ make

	Once the driver is compliles the loadable module 99xx.ko will be created in the same folder.

	**  '$' --this symbol represent the shell prompt on linux			

Loading the Driver:
-------------------
	
	To load the driver use the following command:
		$ insmod 99xx.ko

	**  '$' --this symbol represent the shell prompt on linux			

Unloading the Driver:
---------------------

	To unload the driver use the following command:
		$rmmod 99xx

	**  '$' --this symbol represent the shell prompt on linux			

Installing the Driver:
----------------------

	To install the driver use the following command:
		
		make install

Uninstalling the Driver:
------------------------

	To un-install the driver use the following command:
		
		make uninstall

Features Supported:
-------------------

	The driver supports all the features supported by the MCS99XX serial device.
		Note: only baud rates upto 3.0Mbps are implemented in the current driver.
	
Feature Configuration:
----------------------

	This driver comes with a static array uart_99xx_contxts[ ] for all the 16 ports features in the 99xx.c file.
	Where u can set the features like:
		-DMA in RX
		-DMA in TX
		-enable/disable Flow control
		-Flow control type
		-RX fifo trigger level
		-TX fifo trigger level
		-x-on character
		-x-off character

	An example array setting for PORT 0 which will be recognised as /dev/ttyF0:			

	//Port 0	--**This represents that this setting is for port 0 which will be recognised as /dev/ttyF0
	{
		.rx_dma_en	= 0,
		.tx_dma_en	= 0,
		.uart_mode	= MCS99XX_RS232_MODE,
		.en_flow_control	= 0,
		.flow_ctrl_type 	= MCS99XX_XON_XOFF_HW_FLOWCONTROL,
		.rxfifotrigger	= 64,
		.txfifotrigger	= 64,		
		.x_on		= SERIAL_DEF_XON,
		.x_off		= SERIAL_DEF_XOFF,
	},

To change the port to different modes for uart_mode settings use the following,

MCS99XX_RS422_MODE           (422 mode)
MCS99XX_RS485_HALF_DUPLEX    (485 half duplex)
MCS99XX_RS485_FULL_DUPLEX    (485 full duplex)

Kernels:
--------

	This driver is currently developed and tested on 2.6.15 linux kernel and above 	

Limitations:
------------

	This driver supports a maximum of 16 serial devices. This can be modified as required		
	

Steps for setting parallel port :
---------------------------------
        1. rmmod lp
        2. rmmod parport_pc
        2. insmod /usr/lib/modules/2.6.15/kernel/drivers/parport/parport_pc io=0xb000 irq=10.

Note: Here, the io and irq should be noted from lspci -v.
